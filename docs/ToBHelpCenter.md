- When you choose `Whitelist` as your rewards, then you need to select a network.

![Untitled](TO%20B%20Help%20Center/Untitled%2012.png)

If you’d like to give every participants rewards, you should turn on the `All Eligible Users` and move to the next setting.

![Untitled](TO%20B%20Help%20Center/Untitled%2013.png)

Or you need to input the number of winners and choose the way to select winners.

There are 2 ways to draw winners - `Automatically` and `Manually` .

![Untitled](TO%20B%20Help%20Center/Untitled%2014.png)

If you choose `Automatically` , then you need to choose the way to select winners - `FCFS` or `Randomly`.

![Untitled](TO%20B%20Help%20Center/Untitled%2015.png)

If you choose `Manually` , you need to upload the winner list after the campaign ends.
