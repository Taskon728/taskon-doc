# Possible issues during use

## 1. Why does it show that "the account has already been bound"

Currently, each Twitter/Discord account can only be bound to one wallet address.

If you wish to switch accounts, you must first unbind the account from the old address, and then log in to the new address to bind your Discord/Twitter account.

## 2. What’s the meaning of "duplicate binding" error message?

This happens when you try to bind your Twitter/Discord account to a wallet address that is already linked to another Twitter/Discord account. Each wallet address can only be linked to one Twitter/Discord account at a time. If you want to switch the linked account, you'll need to first unlink the old account from the wallet address, then log in with the new account and link it. Note that you can only switch bindings once a month.

## 3. Why does my quote tweet task always fail validation?

If you are experiencing issues with validating your quote tweet task, please ensure that you are using the "Quote" function and tagging the specified users, rather than using "Reply". You can refer to the picture tutorial below for guidance:

1. Click on the icon and select "Quote Tweet".
2. Tag three friends by entering "@" before their usernames.
3. After editing, click "Retweet" to publish.

Please note that the accounts you tag must be valid and not frozen, otherwise the validation will fail.

## 4. Why do I keep getting "Verification Failed" when I finish Twitter/Discord tasks?

If you encounter verification issues, please follow these steps:

1. Click the blue link to complete the task and then click Verify.
2. Avoid clicking "Verify" too frequently. If the verification still fails, wait 15 minutes and try again.
3. Ensure that your current TaskOn connected Twitter/Discord account matches the account you're currently logged in with.

For smoother campaign participation, we recommend using a PC. If you still have issues after following the above steps, please provide your address, Twitter handle, and campaign name to the #｜bug-report channel. We will pass your feedback to the development team.

# About Rewards

## 5. Where to check the campaign winners list?

Usually you can check the winners list in the following three places.

1. The details page of the TaskOn campaign;
2. The Twitter and community of the project party holding the event;
3. We will also announce the list of winners and the method of claiming awards on the #winnerlist channel.

If the above lists are inconsistent, please refer to the list of winners provided by the project party hosting the campaign, because some project parties will filter out users who have not completed the task.
