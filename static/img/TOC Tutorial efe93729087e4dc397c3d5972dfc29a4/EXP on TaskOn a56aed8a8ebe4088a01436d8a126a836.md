# EXP on TaskOn

EXP stands for the point system on TaskOn, and users can earn EXP by participating in activities. Users can exchange their EXP for more benefits once they have accumulated a certain amount.

## What's the use of EXP?

EXP serves as a measure of a user's level of participation in TaskOn activities. The higher your EXP, the higher your level, and the more opportunities you have to participate in higher-level activities and earn greater rewards.

Additionally, our team takes a user's EXP into account when evaluating their contribution to the product. Users with higher EXP have a greater chance of receiving airdrop rewards in the future.
